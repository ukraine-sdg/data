REC_USE_LIM: 2018-2019 — When compiling the GCR 2018, a new methodology was applied in order to expand the scope of processes in the global economy: а sub-index score was calculated based on a 100-point scale (100 points – ideal state or “threshold” of competitiveness). In previous reports, the score was based on a 7-point scale. Most of the subindices have been reformatted. Therefore, it is incorrect to compare the country’s ranking in the GCR 2017 and GCR 2018 with previous rankings determined using the old methodology. Ukraine’s ranking by sub-indexes in GCR 2017 was not recalculated according to the new methodology.
