REC_USE_LIM: 2018-2019 — Starting from GCR 2018, new methodology is applied to assess the country's position. The assessment by sub-indices is calculated on a 100-point scale (100 points is an ideal state or the "border" of competitiveness). In previous reports, the assessment was calculated on a 7-point scale. Most of the sub-indices were reformatted. Therefore, to compare the positions of the country, given in GCR 2018 and further ratings, with those of the previous ratings, which were assessed using old methodology, is incorrect. <br> 2020-2023 — There is no information on SDG indicator on the World Economic Forum website.
